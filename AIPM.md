#### Agenda: Reviewing the Anti Sedition Framework in India

*The AIPM is a forum for every corner of the Indian polity to express their views.*

It is an attempt at bringing consensus regarding issues that purge the worldâ€™s largest democracy. It is a forum to learn
of the high standards set by the Indian constitution and an attempt to measure up to it.

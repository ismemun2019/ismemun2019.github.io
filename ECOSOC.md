*ECOSOC, one of the six main organs of the United Nations established by the UN Charter in 1946,
is the principal body for coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and recommendations on
economic, social and environmental issues, as well as for implementation of internationally
agreed development goals.*

The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is the United Nation’s
central platform for reflection, debate, and innovative thinking on sustainable development.

Roy Marcus Cohn said, “I don’t want to know what the law is, I want to know who the judge is.”
Cohn realized the value of the position of the judge and how vital it is to the functioning of the law.
Similarly, a Secretary General and an Executive Board (EB) is essential for the smooth functioning
of the committees in a MUN. The Executive Board of each committee in ISME MUN 2019 consists
of a Chairperson, Vice Chairperson, and a Moderator, to ensure that the committee is guided
efficiently.
